<!-- About Me Section -->
<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hey there! I'm a Software Developer with a passion for creativity and technology. I recently graduated with a Master’s in Computer Science from George Mason University, with a concentration in Machine Learning. My journey bridges software engineering and artistic expression, allowing me to craft digital experiences that are both functional and visually compelling.
    </p>    
    <p>
        With expertise in web development, front-end technologies, and data analysis, I enjoy designing intuitive user interfaces and exploring the latest tech trends. Whether I’m developing interactive applications, working on machine learning models, or experimenting with new frameworks, I love solving problems with a blend of logic and creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond coding, I’m an artist at heart, passionate about painting, mandala patterns, calligraphy, and digital art. This creative mindset enhances my approach to software development, helping me build engaging, aesthetically pleasing user experiences.
    </p>  
    <p>
        I wanted to create this portfolio as a reflection of my technical and creative skills, blending my love for design and development into an interactive experience.
    </p>    
     <p>
        Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
